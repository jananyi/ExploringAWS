This repository contains my hands-on experiments with AWS Free Tier services, where I practice deploying, configuring, and managing applications on the cloud.

üå©Ô∏è What‚Äôs inside?

Static Website Hosting: Deployed a fully serverless website using Amazon S3 for storage, CloudFront for global content delivery, and optional Route 53 for DNS management, ensuring low latency and high scalability.

EC2 Web Application: Launched an Amazon Linux VM, installed Node.js, and served a web app while configuring security groups for HTTP/SSH access to learn compute provisioning and remote management.

File Backup System: Designed a personal backup solution with file metadata stored in Amazon RDS (MySQL) and actual files in S3, connected via a script for seamless upload and logging.

Serverless Notes API: Built a CRUD-capable REST API using API Gateway, AWS Lambda (Node.js), DynamoDB, and IAM roles, enabling scalable, cost-efficient operations without server management.

CI/CD Automation: Created an end-to-end pipeline with CodePipeline monitoring GitHub, CodeBuild compiling the app, and automated deployment to EC2/S3, streamlining development workflows.

üéØ Purpose

This repo is part of my cloud learning journey, where I document:

How to use AWS Free Tier efficiently

Step-by-step deployments for practice

Real-world mini-projects to strengthen AWS skills

üîß Tech & Tools

AWS EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFront

Node.js / Express.js (for backend practice)

MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

Linux / Windows Servers

GitHub (for version control and project tracking)

üìå Notes

These projects are purely for learning and exploration under AWS Free Tier.
I‚Äôll keep updating this repo as I try more services and build new projects.
