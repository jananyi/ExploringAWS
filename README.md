This repository contains my hands-on experiments with AWS Free Tier services, where I practice deploying, configuring, and managing applications on the cloud.

🌩️ What’s inside?

Static Website Hosting – Hosting on Amazon S3 and serving via CloudFront

EC2 Instances – Setting up Linux & Windows servers

Databases – Exploring RDS and MongoDB Atlas integration

Serverless – AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway

Authentication – Secure login credentials and IAM roles

Networking – VPC, Security Groups, and Load Balancers

🎯 Purpose

This repo is part of my cloud learning journey, where I document:

How to use AWS Free Tier efficiently

Step-by-step deployments for practice

Real-world mini-projects to strengthen AWS skills

🔧 Tech & Tools

AWS EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFront

Node.js / Express.js (for backend practice)

MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

Linux / Windows Servers

GitHub (for version control and project tracking)

📌 Notes

These projects are purely for learning and exploration under AWS Free Tier.
I’ll keep updating this repo as I try more services and build new projects.
